## Quickstart

Firsts thing's first:

- Create a github user.
- Take note of this user (in the steps above, we'll be using `johndoe`, yet be sure to replace with your actual user for them to work).
- Open a terminal and fire the commands below:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/leonardoquevedox/leonardoquevedox.github.io johndoe.github.io
```

```
$ cd johndoe.github.io
```

In order to install the project dependencies, run:

```
$ yarn
```

#### Customizing

From the root of the cloned repository, run:

```sh
$ yarn dev
```

#### Deploy

In your template, you can declare the ngx-credit-card-br as the following:

```sh
$ yarn build
```

```sh
$ git subtree push --prefix public origin gh-pages
```

### And that's all there is about it.
